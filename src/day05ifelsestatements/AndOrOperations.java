        	 	|| means "or": If you use "||" between 2 things it means at least 1 of them is enough for you
	 	               For example; "tea || coffee" means just tea, or just coffee, or both

	 	               To get false from || operation all must be false
	 	               true || true ==> true
	 	               true || false ==> true
	 	               false || true ==> true
	 	               false || false ==> false

	 	        	 Note: "|" checks both conditions.
	                       "||" does not check the second condition, if first one is true
	                       "||" is faster than "|"


       && means "and":  If you use "&&" between 2 things it means you want both.
	 	                For example; "tea && coffee" means I want both, just one of them will not be enough

	 	                To get true from && operation all must be true.
	 	                true && true ==> true
	 	                true && false ==> false
	 	                false && true ==> false
	 	                false && false ==> false

	 	& means "and":  If you use "&" between 2 things it means you want both.
	 	                For example; "tea & coffee" means I want both, just one of them will not be enough

	 	                To get true from && operation all must be true.
	 	                true & true ==> true
	 	                true & false ==> false
	 	                false & true ==> false
	 	                false & false ==> false

	 	Note: "&" and "&&" do the same but
	 		  "&&" does not check the second condition if the first condition is false.
	 		  "&" checks both conditions every time.
