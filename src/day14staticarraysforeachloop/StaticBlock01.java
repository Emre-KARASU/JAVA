        Sometimes we need some data just after the class loaded.
        For that kind of scenarios we use "static block".
        When you use static block it will be executed before "main method", "any other methods", "constructors", I mean it will be the first to execute
        Note: Static Block is used to initialize "static variables" when we want them before everything in the class
        Note: If you have multiple "static blocks" execution order will be from top to down
