        What is the difference between "primitive" and "non-primitive" data types?
        1)primitive data types contain just values, non-primitive data types contain value + method
        2)primitive data type names use just lowercase characters, but non-primitive data type names use uppercase at the beginning
        3)primitive data types were created by Java, developers cannot create primitive data types.
          But non-primitive data types can be created by Java and by any developer.
        4)non-primitive data types use same size area in memory but primitive data types use different size area in memory
